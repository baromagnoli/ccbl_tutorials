## WHAT IS IDE?

An IDE is known as an Integrated Development Environment and has the function of conglomerating different aspects of writing a program such as editing source code, building executables and debugging into a single application.

It's useful because it simplifies code development and can minimize coding mistakes and typos. Without an IDE, many developers spend too much time trying to decide which tools should be used for various tasks, configuring the tools and learning how to use them efficiently.

Some IDEs are open source, while others are commercial offerings. An IDE can be a standalone application or it can be part of a larger package. Developers must match the IDE they use with the type of application they want to produce.

A few examples of IDEs are: PyCharm, NetBeans, IntelliJ Idea and Eclipse.

## EDITING SOURCE CODE

-  SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING

It is a feature that IDE has that makes reading code much easier because it visually clarifies different elements of language syntax.

-  AUTOCOMPLETE

When IDE knows in which language you are developing your code, it makes writing much more efficient by anticipating what you are going to type next.

## BUILDING EXECUTABLES

The compilation process is necessary for all programs so the IDE provides automated build processes for languages, so the act of compiling and executing code is abstracted away.

##  DEBUGGING

It is nearly impossible to write a program without encountering any errors or bugs. When a program does not run correctly, IDEs provide debugging tools that allow programmers to examine different variables and inspect their code in a deliberate way.
